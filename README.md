## Installation

To install from NPM:

```shell
npm install @brightspace-ui-labs/edit-in-place
```

## Usage

```html
<script type="module">
    import '@brightspace-ui-labs/d2l-labs-edit-in-place.js';
</script>
<d2l-labs-edit-in-place placeholder="Edit Me"></d2l-labs-edit-in-place>
```

**Properties:**
- `value` (String): value of the input
- `placeholder`String, default: `'Enter a value'`): placeholder text of the input. If `value` is blank, this appears in italics as the label. `placeholder` must not be blank.
- `size`(Number): length of the input
- `maxlength`(Number): imposes an upper character limit
- `readonly`(Boolean): The label will behave like a simple text element if true.

**Events:**

The `d2l-labs-edit-in-place` dispatches the `change` event when text is saved via pressing the Enter key while focusing the input, or by pressing the save button:

```javascript
editInPlace.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
  console.log(editInPlace.value);
});
```

### Headers
`d2l-labs-edit-in-place` can be used in headers and other section-related elements by wrapping it within the desired element:
```html
<script type="module">
    import '@brightspace-ui-labs/edit-in-place/edit-in-place.js';
</script>
<h2>
    <d2l-labs-edit-in-place placeholder="Edit Me"></d2l-labs-edit-in-place>
</h2>
```


## Developing, Testing and Contributing

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

If you don't have it already, install the [Polymer CLI](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli) globally:

```shell
npm install -g polymer-cli
```

### Running the demos

To start a [local web server](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli-commands#serve) that hosts the demo page and tests:

```shell
polymer serve
```
The demo page can be found at http://127.0.0.1:8081/components/@brightspace-ui-labs/edit-in-place/demo/d2l-labs-edit-in-place.html.
Note the port number your shell outputs; If it differs from the above URL, change the URL accordingly.

### Testing

To lint ([eslint](http://eslint.org/) and [Polymer lint](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli-commands#lint)):

```shell
npm run lint
```

To run unit tests locally using [Polymer test](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli-commands#tests):

```shell
npm run test:polymer:local
```

To lint AND run local unit tests:

```shell
npm test
```
## Versioning & Releasing

> TL;DR: Commits prefixed with `fix:` and `feat:` will trigger patch and minor releases when merged to `master`. Read on for more details...

The [sematic-release GitHub Action](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/master/semantic-release) is called from the `release.yml` GitHub Action workflow to handle version changes and releasing.

### Version Changes

All version changes should obey [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules:
1. **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

The next version number will be determined from the commit messages since the previous release. Our semantic-release configuration uses the [Angular convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular) when analyzing commits:
* Commits which are prefixed with `fix:` or `perf:` will trigger a `patch` release. Example: `fix: validate input before using`
* Commits which are prefixed with `feat:` will trigger a `minor` release. Example: `feat: add toggle() method`
* To trigger a MAJOR release, include `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines in the footer of the commit message
* Other suggested prefixes which will **NOT** trigger a release: `build:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:` and `test:`. Example: `docs: adding README for new component`

To revert a change, add the `revert:` prefix to the original commit message. This will cause the reverted change to be omitted from the release notes. Example: `revert: fix: validate input before using`.

### Releases

When a release is triggered, it will:
* Update the version in `package.json`
* Tag the commit
* Create a GitHub release (including release notes)
* Deploy a new package to NPM

### Releasing from Maintenance Branches

Occasionally you'll want to backport a feature or bug fix to an older release. `semantic-release` refers to these as [maintenance branches](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/workflow-configuration#maintenance-branches).

Maintenance branch names should be of the form: `+([0-9])?(.{+([0-9]),x}).x`.

Regular expressions are complicated, but this essentially means branch names should look like:
* `1.15.x` for patch releases on top of the `1.15` release (after version `1.16` exists)
* `2.x` for feature releases on top of the `2` release (after version `3` exists)
